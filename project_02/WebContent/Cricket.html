	<h1>Cricket is a sport that combines strategy, skill, and
		teamwork, captivating millions of fans worldwide. Played between two
		teams of eleven players, the game revolves around batting, bowling,
		and fielding, with the primary goal of scoring more runs than the
		opposing team. The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman, who
		attempts to hit it and run between wickets to score, while the
		fielding team tries to prevent runs and dismiss the batsmen</h1>
